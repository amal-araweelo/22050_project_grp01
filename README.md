# A basic DSP pipeline

This repository contains the implementation of a **basic digital signal processing (DSP) pipeline** developed as part of the 22051 course project.  
All parameters are specified in the file **`global_specs.txt`**, and the entire system can be executed by running **`main.mlx`**.

## Folder structure
The main script is located in the project root. This is where the code is executed. All functions called in main script are located in the folder **`function/`**, figures (10x15 cm) are saved as PDFs in the **`figures/`** folder and all the relevant raw signals are saved as a .mat(/ or something else) in the folder **`outputs/`**. 
Audio files are located in the folder **`sounds/`**.
